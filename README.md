3270font: A font for the nostalgic
==================================

A little bit of history
-----------------------

This font is derived from the x3270 font, which, in turn, was translated from the one in GATech's 3270tool, which was itself hand-copied from a 3270 terminal. I built it because I felt terminals deserve to be pretty. The .sfd font file contains a x3270 bitmap font that was used for guidance.

The format
----------

This font was built with FontForge. You'll need it if you want to generate fonts for your platform. On most civilized operating systems, you can simply `apt-get install fontforge`, `yum install fontforge` or even `port install fontforge`. On others, you may need to grab your copy from http://fontforge.org/. I encourage you to drop by and read the tutorials.

An .otf version is in the repository for those who would just like to use it.

Contributing
------------

I don't think GitHub's pull-request mechanism is FontForge-friendly. If you want to contribute (there are a lot of missing glyphs, such as the APL set and most non-latin alphabets which most likely never built into 3270 terminals), get in touch and we may figure out how to do it correctly.

Preserving history
------------------

I regard the history of electronic computing a very important part of our civilization's history. Consider donating to entities that help preserve it, such as the Computer History Museum (http://www.computerhistory.org/), the IT History Society (http://ithistory.org/) and many others around the world. If you have a historically significant piece of technology in your closet or garage, consider contacting a local technology or industrial-design-oriented museum for advice.
